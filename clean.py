# After droping those two columns, we're left with the glaring fact that the features regarding Hardware, for a particular game, will either consist of 1's
# 
# $$ [\text{ Graphics }, \text{ Memory}, \text{ OS}, \text{ Processor}, \text{ Storage}] = [1,1,1,1,1]$$
# 
# or actually consist of legible hardware data ( for example, `Maneater` has the following) :
# 
# $$ [\text{ Graphics }, \text{ Memory}, \text{ OS}, \text{ Processor}, \text{ Storage}] = [\text{ Intel HD 5500 }, \text{ 8 GB RAM}, \text{ Windows 10}, \text{ ProIntel Core i5-5300ucessor}, \text{ 20 GB available space} ]$$
# 
# But the rest of the data (User tags, Rating, Publisher, Review count, etc) is far more intact.
# 
# Thus, we can remove (or keep) the hardware columns depending on if we're going to work on them.
# 
# So at the end, we make csv files of both versions.

# Game Plan:
# 
# 1) Convert all RAM requirements in MB into GB using the fact that $1024 \text{ MB } = 1 \text{ GB }$
# 
# 2) Convert all Storage Requirements in MB to GB using the same fact as in (1)
# 
# Since both of these aforementioned features use similar units, we convert everything to GB = 1024 MB
# 
# 3) The hope with the `OS` column was that there'd be a mix of say `Windows`, `Windows/MacOs`, `MacOs/Linux`, etc. But, they're all Windows, and the `Release Date` column provides finer Date info, so we see no reason to keep. So, drop it.
